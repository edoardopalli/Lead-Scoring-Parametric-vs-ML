# Lead-Scoring-Parametric-vs-ML
Classification problem of the leads for an insurtech, in order to establish a commercial priority of them. Comparison between logistic regression and neural network classifiers.

## About the Project
The insurtech company I collaborated with is a digital broker based in Italy, intermediating between insurance companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, privates, offering a smart, full digital and customized insurance policy. New clients land in the website page, fill in the survey and a quote is available. Then they can subscribe a policy online with a full digital experience. Prospects that do not finish this procedure autonomously are managed by the sales department, deciding how to finalize the acquisition: by an intern sales consultant, by a call center or not finalizing the acquisition. In order to optimally allocate the business resources of company, a classification tool is built, using both parametric and nonparametric tequinques: a multinomial logistic regression model and a neural network classifier have been developed, comparing the performance in the goodness of fit and prediction.
